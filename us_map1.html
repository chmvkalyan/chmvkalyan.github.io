        <h2>Vaccinations across County</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          The below map depicts the geographgic distribution of vaccinations
          across counties in the United States of America. Here, plotting has
          been done on the "Fully Vaccinated Percentages" among the age groups
          12 and up, 18 and up, 65 and up, and All Ages. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          About 193.8 million people have received at least one dose of a
          COVID-19 vaccine, including about 165.9 million people who have been
          fully vaccinated by Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine or the
          two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. About 70.6
          percent of adults have received at least one shot. President Biden set
          a goal on May 4 of reaching 70 percent of adults by July 4, but it
          took almost a month extra to reach that national target. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Speed isn’t the only priority for the country’s vaccination campaign.
          The Biden administration has also committed to distributing shots
          equitably to the communities most affected by the pandemic. Yet more
          than seven months into the rollout, the most socially vulnerable
          counties in the U.S. have a lower vaccination rate on average than the
          nation’s least vulnerable. The majority of the most disadvantaged
          counties with the fewest fully vaccinated people are in the South,
          while the most vaccinated, least vulnerable counties are in the
          Midwest and Northeast.
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Counties are ranked according to the Social Vulnerability Index, a
          C.D.C. indicator used in public health crises that is based on
          socioeconomic status, housing, transportation, race, ethnicity and
          language. Each county’s vaccination rate is its share of all residents
          that have been fully vaccinated, a figure that does not reflect those
          who have only received one dose of a two-shot vaccine.
