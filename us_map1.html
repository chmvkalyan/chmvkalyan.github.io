      <h2>Vaccinations across County</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">
      About 193.8 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19
      vaccine, including about 165.9 million people who have been fully
      vaccinated by Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine or the two-dose
      series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. <br />
      About 70.6 percent of adults have received at least one shot. President
      Biden set a goal on May 4 of reaching 70 percent of adults by July 4, but
      it took almost a month extra to reach that national target. <br />
      Speed isn’t the only priority for the country’s vaccination campaign. The
      Biden administration has also committed to distributing shots equitably to
      the communities most affected by the pandemic. <br />
      Yet more than seven months into the rollout, the most socially vulnerable
      counties in the U.S. have a lower vaccination rate on average than the
      nation’s least vulnerable. The majority of the most disadvantaged counties
      with the fewest fully vaccinated people are in the South, while the most
      vaccinated, least vulnerable counties are in the Midwest and Northeast.
      <br />
      Counties are ranked according to the Social Vulnerability Index, a C.D.C.
      indicator used in public health crises that is based on socioeconomic
      status, housing, transportation, race, ethnicity and language. Each
      county’s vaccination rate is its share of all residents that have been
      fully vaccinated, a figure that does not reflect those who have only
      received one dose of a two-shot vaccine.
