        <h2>County Wise Risk Analysis</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          The below map depicts the COVID-19 risk for unvaccinated people based
          on the cases and test positivity in the each county. A majority of
          United States counties were experiencing very high COVID-19
          transmission in early August, according to an analysis of coronavirus
          case and testing data by The New York Times and public health experts.
          This means that unvaccinated people in those counties are at very high
          risk. Vaccinated people are at minimal risk. <br />

        <strong>About the COVID-19 Risk Levels</strong>
        <p>
          Each countyâ€™s COVID-19 risk is primarily based on the number of cases
          reported per capita during the past 7 days. Additional precautions are
          suggested if more than 10 percent of tests had a positive result over
          the past 7 days of available data. This can mean that the county is
          not testing enough, and that the number of cases may be undercounted.
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Although risk levels are assigned based on expert guidance and careful
          analysis, it is possible that the risk level in a specific county may
          be over- or underestimated because of a lack of reliable data.
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          A county is at
          <li>
            an <mark5> extremely high risk</mark5> for unvaccinated people if it
            reported an average daily rate of more than 45 cases per 100,000
            people.
