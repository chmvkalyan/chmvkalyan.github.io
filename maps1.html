        <h2>Vaccinations Per Country Over Time</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          The below map depicts the geographic distribution of vaccinations
          across the World. The color gradient changes from lighter pale green
          to darker pale green ranging from low to high "Vaccinations (per
          Hunderd)". Slider faciliates the option to choose a time frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than 4.36 billion vaccines doses have been administered
          worldwide, equal to 57 doses for every 100 people. There is already a
          stark gap between vaccination programs in different countries, as this
          map shows.
        </p>
        <p>
          A vaccinated person refers to someone who has received at least one
          dose of a vaccine, and a fully vaccinated person has received all
          required doses of a vaccine. For the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, a person
          who is “fully vaccinated” has received two doses.
        </p>
        <p>
          While vaccine doses remain relatively scarce globally, most countries
          have focused their early vaccination efforts on priority groups like
          the clinically vulnerable; people in their 60s, 70s and older; and
          front-line workers, like doctors and nurses.
