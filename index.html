      <p class="subtitle">COVID-19 Overview</p>

      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first
      identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an
      ongoing pandemic. The first confirmed case has been traced back to 17
      November 2019 in Hubei. As of 1 August 2020, more than 17.5 million cases
      have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more
      than 679,000 deaths. More than 10.3 million people have recovered.

      <p class="subtitle">COVID-19 Testing is important</p>

      The COVID-19 testing is important to prevent the spread of the virus in
      the community. Less than three percent of the world population has been
      tested to date. The testing has mainly been on demand testing (PCR). Two
      kinds of tests are used to determine COVID-19 infection. 1. The PCR test
      (polymerase chain reaction test), can be done with a throat swab and
      determines if you have the infection now. This test is used for those
      concerned if they have the virus because of symptoms. 2. The Antibody test
      has growing interest as it can determine if you have been infected with
      the virus and fought off the disease. Both tests have many false
      positives, and recent exposure, particularly with the antibody test, may
      not trigger a positive for one to three weeks. The antibody test is a
      better test to determine the infectivity rate in the community. Most
      people seeking a test do so because they have symptoms (PCR) but is not
      helpful in determining how many in the community have been exposed.

      <p class="subtitle">COVID-19 Vaccines are safe</p>

      COVID-19 vaccines were developed using science that has been around for
      decades. COVID-19 vaccines are not experimental. They went through all the
      required stages of clinical trials. Extensive testing and monitoring have
      shown that these vaccines are safe and effective. COVID-19 vaccines have
      received and continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in
      history. Learn more about how federal partners are ensuring COVID-19
      vaccines work.
